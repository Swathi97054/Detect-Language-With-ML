Language Detection Using Machine Learning 
Language detection is the process of identifying the language of a given text using machine learning techniques. This task is crucial in applications such as search engines, social media analysis, and multilingual chatbots.
This project builds a language detection model using Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, a commonly used algorithm for text classification. The model is trained on a dataset containing 22 different languages, with 1,000 sentences per language, making it well-balanced.
The code runs accordingly as below 
1.The user inputs a sentence.
2.The input text is converted into numerical format using CountVectorizer.
3.The trained model predicts the language of the input text.
4.The model achieves high accuracy since the dataset is balanced.
